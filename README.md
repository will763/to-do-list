# To Do List 📖

This project was developed during the TQI Fullstack Developer bootcamp on the Digital innovation one platform.
The project was to attend a mentorship, in which unit testing was demonstrated in an api made with Spring Boot,
from there the objective was to perform unit tests with the acquired knowledge.
So I created a rest api with Spring Boot for a to do list app, and then developed a frontend to use it.
